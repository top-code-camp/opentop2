This is the second exercise for our top-code camp. 

The goal of this exercise is to identify the objects (data and methods) that can be used in more than one project.

Next exercise is to apply the objects written in this exercise to a new code for 3D topology optimization.

Anaconda cloud is a useful place to find already built packages with easy installation.
For example, the following commands install nlopt and cvxopt used by the topopt codes:
conda install -c acellera nlopt 
conda install -c conda-forge cvxopt
